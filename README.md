# Kotlinfirstgithub
# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Kotlin language.}

I have a particular app I want to make. This app will require me to learn how to track location along with many other new things. To start I made this program to slowly become more and more familiar with the Kotlin language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Item 1 I want it to track location
- Item 2 I want it to save input from the user
- Item 3 I want it to display the note the user (or someone who knows the user) made previously as a reminder for the user when they reach the desired location. For instance, the user or their family could enter into a note that when the person arrives at the store it displays their note which was a grocery list. Or if the user arrives at the bank their note displays reminding them to grab extra checks.
